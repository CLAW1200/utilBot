# Bugs:
- MAKE IMAGE GEN ASYNC
- If the previous game has not concluded and another game is started by someone else, the previous game gives an "interaction failed" message when played. The issue occurs even if two completely different people start a game.
- Already transparent gifs get kinda fucky with speech bubble
- Embed gif grabbing gets a lower quality version
- !stats command and !stats user showing all
# Improvements:
add new line to stats graph with rolling avg of command usage or difference over prev hour
add optional input to /help that will provide a explanation on a command
# New Features:
- Add embed navigation to the help command
