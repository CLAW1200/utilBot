# Bugs:
- Speech-bubble does not work with some images????? WHY?! need more testing

- If the previous game has not concluded and another game is started by someone else, the previous game gives an "interaction failed" message when played. The issue occurs even if two completely different people start a game.
- Already transparent gifs get kinda fucky with /speech bubble
- Embed gif grabbing gets a lower quality version
# Improvements:
add optional input to /help that will provide a explanation on a command

# New Features:
- Add embed navigation to the help command  

# Not Possible or Not Supported
- Input Message Link for image-to-gif, etc. Not possible because bot does not have message intent
