# Bugs:

- If the previous game has not concluded and another game is started by someone else, the previous game gives an "interaction failed" message when played. The issue occurs even if two completely different people start a game.
- Fix image to gif on Giffy links failing to convert, need to capture gif from page as it is not a direct link same with other sites

# New Features:
- Add embed navigation to the help command

# Improvements:
- Allow direct file upload to the commands such as image and speech bubble. i dont even know how people are attaching files to the commands, you cant do it in the web version of discord at least
- Make speech bubble transparent 
- Make user / guild tracking add to the csv only once per hour, not every time the command is run
